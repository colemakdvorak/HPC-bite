# HPC bite

Although wise elders advise me not to stare at languages on the lower side of the power spectrum for too long, I just find every level of programming abstraction fascinating - and strongly feel programs designed for numerically intensive tasks don't get exposed to people of my generation as much despite its deep origins and widespread use. Since I have free time at hand, I decided to take time to implement some numerical tricks I learned during education in Fortran.

Hence this repo has no practical value, it's mostly for learning, reviewing, and entertainment. I just want to appreciate things like BLAS/LAPACK hidden behind numpy, or any libraries/languages that serves as an interface between these programs and users.

Wrote my first Fortran 77 code.

### BLAS
Started looking at level 1.

#### Level 1
- ?ASUM: Implemented for single precision float vector and wrote a short journal.
